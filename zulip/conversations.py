"""Stable conversation identity for Zulip topics (stable topic sessions).

Zulip topics have no IDs (zulip/zulip#1191): a topic is just the ``subject``
string shared by messages, and renaming bulk-rewrites it. This store mints an
opaque, stable ``conversation_id`` per conversation and tracks the mapping
``(channel_id, topic_name) -> conversation_id`` so Hermes sessions survive
topic renames.

Routing rules implemented here (see ISSUE.md in the project docs):

- R1 ``resolve``: unknown name -> mint a new conversation id (label reuse
  after a rename therefore starts a NEW conversation).
- R2 ``repoint``: full rename (``propagate_mode=change_all``) moves the
  conversation to the new name; the old name keeps only a NULL-membership
  audit row (no beneficiary — a recreated old name cannot adopt it).
- R3: partial moves (``change_one``/``change_later``, any channel) are NOT
  registry operations — the caller simply does not call this store for
  them; the source topic keeps its session and the new name resolves to a
  new conversation on its first message.
- R5 collisions: renaming onto a live name displaces the previous mapping
  into the target topic's own session set (a former member) so the renamed
  conversation takes the name.
- R7 ``rebind``: manual ``/continue <session-id>`` re-binds a topic to a
  FORMER member of its own session set (inheritance-scoped: own sessions
  plus full-rename/merge inheritance; never a session held elsewhere or
  orphaned).
- R8 ``free``: full cross-channel moves free the old mapping without a
  successor — the session set has no beneficiary and is orphaned.
- R9 ``sessions_for_topic``: the topic's session set for ``/topic-sessions``.
- R10 ``orphan_topic_sessions``: a topic deleted without rename/merge has
  no beneficiary — its whole session set is orphaned (membership NULL).

Former-session records power ``/continue`` and make label-reuse
disambiguation auditable.
